# weirdchess

This is a weird chess - checkers variant.
The rules are very simple.
it is more like checkers in the way that all pieces are equal.
all pieces can move one square towards any direction(up down left right or diagonally).
BUT they cannot occupy the place of other pieces or capture them in any way.
The first player to reach the other side of the board wins.

The game is a little sloppy and may contain errors esspecially in the advenced settings but i tried to finish this overnight (11:30-05:00)

the software is a python cli game 
you add the coordinates of your piece and your destination as prompted in the format of : x y
any other format will probably crush the game and need to restart.

Thank you and Good Night!
